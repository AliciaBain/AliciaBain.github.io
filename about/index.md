Hello, my name is **Alicia Bain** and I was born and raised in port-au-Prince, Haiti. In 2015, I moved to the United States and have since resided in Miami, FL where I finshed my secondary education in 2018 and started my IT path soon after.

In 2018 I obtained my **Electronic Health Record Specialist Certification** in Miami Dade College, FL. After completeing a Internship in which I ended up being the IT person non-intentionally, I decided to give technology a try. 

Soon I will be getting my **Cloud Support Engineer AWS certification** and by the first quarter of 2020 I am planning to obtain my **Solutions Architect Certification**.
